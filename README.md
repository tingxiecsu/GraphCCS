## GraphCCS
This is the code repo for the paper Prediction of Collision Cross Sections with Graph Convolutional
Network for Metabolites Annotation. We developed a method named GraphCCS which can obtain the data-driven
representations of molecules through the end-to-end learning with GCN, and predict the retention time with 
the GCN-learned representations. The network architecture is showed as follow:
